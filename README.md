# SHELL
It is a replica of bash shell which is created using C. It can handle quotes and space perfectly.

Following commands are implemented:
- cd      : change the working directory
- ls      : list files and directories with inode number
- mkdir   : makes directories
- cp      : copies files
- cpdir   : copy dir (use / at end to source to cp only content and do not use / to copy folder itself)
- touch   : creates a file if doesnt exist
- cat     : display the content of file
- writer  : Sort of editor (append or overwrite)
- echo    : print something
- run     : run some executable
- estatus : exit statues of last command
- exit    : exit shell
- pwd     : prints the working directory
